# Project Scenario and Specification

## Project Scenario

You’ve been hired as an **AI Engineer at a gaming analytics company** developing
an assistant called **UdaPlay**. Executives, analysts, and gamers want to ask natural
language questions like:

* “Who published Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas?”
* “When was Pokémon Gold and Silver released?”
* “What platform was Super Mario 64 launched on?”
* “What is Rockstar Games working on right now?”

The first three can be answered from the project's local dataset of 15 games.
The last one can't, so your agent has to search the web for it.

Your agent should:

1. Attempt to answer the question from internal knowledge (a local dataset of 15
video games)
2. If the information is not found or confidence is low, search the web
3. Generate a clean, structured answer/report that cites its source

Your agent must also remember earlier questions **within a session** (conversation
state). Keeping what it learns **across sessions**, in persistent long-term
memory, is an optional Stand Out extension, not a requirement.

## Project Specifications

In this project, you will build an AI Research Agent called UdaPlay designed to
answer questions about video games. The agent will be capable of:

1. Answering user questions about games, including:

   * Game titles and their details
   * Release dates and platforms
   * Game descriptions and genres
   * Publisher information
2. Using a two-tier information retrieval system:

   * Primary: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) over a local dataset of games
   * Secondary: Web search using the Tavily API when internal knowledge is insufficient
3. Implementing a robust evaluation system:

   * Assessing the quality of retrieved information
   * Determining when to fall back to web search
   * Providing confidence levels in answers
4. Generating clear, well-structured responses that:

   * Cite information sources
   * Combine information from multiple sources when needed
   * Present information in a natural, readable format
